#### What is Morpheous.js?
Morpheous.js is a simple javascript file that can be included in any HTML page. It checks for changes in the HTML file by making XMLHttpRequests and updates the title and body of the current HTML document to match the changed document. This means the document can be in a continuously morphing state; it can become a `morpheous HTML document`.
